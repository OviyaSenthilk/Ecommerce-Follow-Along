**Milestone-1:Project Overveiw**

Introduction

Develop a functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), integrating front-end and back-end technologies with features like user authentication, product listings, and secure checkout.

**MERN Stack Overview**

MongoDB: Stores user, product, and order data.

Express.js: Handles server-side logic, routes, and APIs.

React.js: Builds dynamic, responsive front-end components.

Node.js: Runs the backend server and ensures communication between components.

**Authentication Features**

User Registration: Secure signup with hashed passwords.

Login & Logout: JWT-based session management.

Role-Based Access Control: Differentiates roles (e.g., admin, customer).

Password Reset: Enables secure recovery via email.

Session Management: Maintains secure sessions with token expiration.

**Project Flow**

Setup: Initialize repository, configure tools (Node.js, MongoDB), and create the directory structure.

Back-End Development: Design database schemas, create APIs for authentication and product management, and implement secure middleware.

Front-End Development: Build responsive React components for key pages and use Redux for state management.

Integration: Connect front-end to back-end using APIs and ensure secure communication with JWT.

Testing: Validate API endpoints and perform end-to-end testing for key features.

Deployment: Host the backend (e.g., Heroku) and frontend (e.g., Netlify), using environment variables for configuration.

Maintenance: Monitor performance, gather user feedback, and update features or fix bugs as needed.
